# Calculus_Plotter
This program is to give numerical, symbolic, and visual answers and representations of a given calculus functions. 

This program will take an input function (y=f(x)), and a domain that it is to be plotted on. It will give the derivative and integral of this function, and calculate the length of the curve and are under the curve within the given domain.
